# bdn2csv

bdn2csv is a Python tool to convert SAS Business Data Network (BDN) XML Export file to CSV Import file

As the SAS Business Data Network (BDN) can be:
* imported from XML or CSV file, but
* exported only to CSV file

I developed bdn2csv to transform an XML Export file into the equivalent CSV Import file:

* for a user to edit it as a spreadshit

* for a developer to programmatically process it as a table

and to import the resulting CSV file into SAS BDN.

(WIP and to be also written as a module)
