# bdn2csv

bdn2csv is a Python parser that converts SAS Business Data Network (BDN) XML Export file to CSV Import file

As the SAS Business Data Network (BDN) can be:
* imported from XML or CSV file but
* exported only to XML file,

I developed bdn2csv to transform an XML Export file into an equivalent CSV Import file:

* for a user to edit it as a spreadsheet

* for a developer to programmatically process it as a table

and to import the result CSV file into SAS BDN.

(More to be added and to be also written as a module)
