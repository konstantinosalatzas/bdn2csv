# bdn2csv

bdn2csv is a Python tool to convert SAS Business Data Network (BDN) XML Export file to CSV Import file

As a SAS Business Data Network (BDN) Import file is XML or CSV but an Export file is necessarily XML, it is useful to transform a given XML Export file into an equivalent CSV Import file:

* For a user to edit it as a spreadshit

* For a developer to programmatically process it as a table

and to import the resulting CSV file into SAS BDN

(WIP and to be also written as a module)
